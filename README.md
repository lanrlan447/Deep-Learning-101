# Deep Learning 101


When I started learning deep learning I spent two weeks researching. I selected tools, compared cloud services, and researched online courses. In retrospect, I wish I could have built neural networks from day one. [That’s what this article](http://blog.floydhub.com/my-first-weekend-of-deep-learning) is set out to do. You don’t need any prerequisites, yet a basic understanding of Python, the command line, and Jupyter notebook will help.

This is the code experiments from the article.
